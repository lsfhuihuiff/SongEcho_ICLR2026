[Verse]
I used to be just a simple guy
With a twinkle in my ordinary eye
But for you I became a brand new light
Extinguished my self to brighten your night

[Verse 2]
Turned my eyes into triangles sharp
Painted my skin a pumpkin's Larp
Removed my teeth to widen my grin
For your gaze I wear this orange skin

[Chorus]
Pumpkin head for the one I adore
Changed myself right down to the core
Hollowed out to let my love glow
For you my love I'll always show

[Verse 3]
Carved my life to fit your dreams
Even if it takes me to extremes
No more teeth to bite my words
But do you even love this pumpkin head

[Bridge]
I am a lantern burning bright
Through every shadow and every night
For the love I feel so deep inside
Pumpkin head my love can't hide

[Chorus]
Pumpkin head for the one I adore
Changed myself right down to the core
Hollowed out to let my love glow
For you my love I'll always show
